# Collection of MtG Proxies

This is a collection of proxies for Magic the Gathering.
For now it only includes proxies for double faced cards.

## Wishlist

- Further down the line a script should automatically fetch the data from scrfall and create the pdf automatically.
- Also work for single faced card to create a proxy with the up to date oracle text.
